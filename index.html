    <p>I am a highly motivated individual who has always been passionate about making a positive impact on the environment. That's why I pursued my studies in International and European Affairs at the University of Piraeus, where I discovered my fascination with energy.

        My interest in energy led me to further my education at the Athens University of Business Economics, where I earned my MSc in Law and Economics in Energy markets. I am eager to find opportunities in the energy sector, specifically in renewables. I want to contribute to a better future for our children, and I believe that working in the energy sector is one of the ways to achieve that.
        
        Apart from my professional pursuits, I am also a creative person with a passion for improv comedy theater. I am part of a group called <a href="https://instagram.com/trivolia.improv?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=">Trivolia</a> and we perform shows from time to time. This hobby keeps me mentally stimulated and provides a space for me to express my creativity.
        
        Overall, I am dedicated to sustainability and the environment, and I believe that my education and skills would make me a valuable asset to any company in the energy sector. My passion for improv comedy also highlights my ability to think creatively and work collaboratively, which I believe would make me an excellent team member.
